# Metaverse In Healthcare 

This webpage shows and gives information regaring the emerging IT techonlogy --> Metaverse.
Not only Metaverse but its application in the prominent Healthcare industry 

The webpage has a main menu that has four parts to it 

This webpage has a clock for display of current time as well as the rise of metaverse with time using 5 images with 5 different description to it. It gives information regarding why to choose metaverse and the current Active stakeholders in it. There is a "RELATED" section to the webpage with links to study and get more information about this tech.

Have also implemented a way to greet the user when he enters his name and the webpage has the ability to change themes also by clicking the "TOGGLE THEME" button 

Lastly the webpage has a footer where the Licence for copyright is reserved by me till the year 2050 

I chose this technology in particular because not a lot of people show intrest to it as it is still 7-10 years far but i wanted to provide information about is and to let others know that this is  going to be a vital part of medicure in comming years 

The main challenge i faced was the lack of preparation before hand for this project and a feature i would like to add to this webpage in the future is to make the main menu interactive and also to host this website in the real world
